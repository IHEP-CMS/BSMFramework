This code is based on a preliminary version of the BSM3G code initiated by:
Andres Florez (Los Andes), Alfredo Gurrola (Vanderbilt) and Amandeep Kalsi (Panjab) 
(See https://github.com/florez/NtupleMaker_740)

It has been extended and further developed by Francesco Romeo (IHEP) and Aniello Spiezia (IHEP).

Not all framework branches/tags are compatible with all CMSSW release
and may require the user to update packages from a certain CMSSW release.
For this reason we have added beneath a list of branches and associated 
setup instructions for the framework. The associated setup instructions
are kept in the same directory as this README. 

The name of the developer of the branch should be in the setup script
along with a contact email in case of problems. Alternatively, one can 
check the git repository for more info:
